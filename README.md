# TrafficIncidentGPT

The proposed IncidentResponseGPT - a novel framework that applies generative artificial intelligence to generate response plans based on incident response guidelines and incoming incident reports. This model allows for synthesis of incident response guidelines and generates incident response plans adapted to specific area, aiming to facilitate the decision-making process for traffic management authorities. This approach aims to accelerate incident resolution times by suggesting various actions (e.g. the use of variable message signs) to minimize the overall impact on the urban traffic network. The system suggests specific actions, including lane closures, announcements and dispatching appropriate emergency resources. We also propose the novel application of the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to rank generated response plans based on criteria like impact minimization and resource efficiency and compare solutions based on their proximity to an human-proposed solution.
